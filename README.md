Over the past four years, the [UNDP Accelerator Labs Network](https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs) has been pushing for the mainstreaming of data innovation in sustainable development practice. Here we take stock of these efforts and highlight a certain convergence between computaional techniques, datasources, and application areas. Note the work of the labs is action oriented. Other application areas and convergences undoubtably exist, typically in academic work. The purpose of this compliation is to highlight the application readiness of these techniques x datasources for specific development application areas around the world.

The focus is intentionally reductive. It is on data innovation "projects". It should be noted however, that these are all part of broader portfolios of interventions. Overall, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network sees data innovation a means to an end, not as an objective in itself. 

The next frontier for many of these projects is to establish data collaboratives to ensure their sustainability. More to come on this soonâ€¦

Note we do not cover initiatives like crowdmapping here, as these are covered by the collective intelligence work of the labs.

Remote sensing data, whether low quality satellite imagery of high resolution drone imagery, is the most commonly used data source in the Accelerator Labs Network. This is likely due in part to the relative simplicity of accessing imagery and the maturity of the computational techniques. 

We also see a trend in applicaion areas for this type of data. Agriculture and pastoralism, and pollution and waste management are most common across labs, often trying to detect features in the imagery, like the aggregation of solid waste or crop diseases, or for deriving labd cover and land use maps, and vegetation indices.

We also see a trend across several labs on the use of online posts, typically to travel sites, to understand sub-national toursim dynamics.
